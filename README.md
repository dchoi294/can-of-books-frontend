## Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate? Avaviable anytime but try best to keep to before 10pm.

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? We will be using Slack and Remo.

How often will you take breaks? We will take a 10 minute break every hour to refresh our brain.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind? If we start to fall behind we will just have to spend a little extra time to get it right or complete it over the weekend.

## Cooperative

Make a list of each person’s strengths.

Don Choi - Troublshooting, front-end.

DeShon Dixon - Troubleshooting, back-end.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? I think each of use knows are strengths well and know where we can best utilize them to be as effiecient as possible on this project.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? 

DeShon Dixon - I want to improve my tool proficient and front end ablities.

Don Choi - Want to improve understanding of MongoDB workflow.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? Plan to let Don nagivate the front-end and DeShon will navigate the back-end and figure out the workflow of staying in sync we keep our mics open on remo so if we have any issue we are quickly able to resolve it.

## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? I don't for see us having this issue but we will talk about if this issues happens. If it continues we will notify Sheyna.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? I don't for see us having this issue but we will talk about if this issues happens. If it continues we will notify Sheyna.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? We both have been able to communicate very well together and stay in contact via Slack and keep our mics open on Remo.
